## Motivation
I wanted to explore a bit possibilities around user input, using command line utility, which would be helpful while creating static Go binaries.

Such binaries must act upon user input, like:
* connect to specific server
* port
* api end-point
* etc

Also, all parameters must be logged to the stdout.
